# Pneumonia detection on chest X-ray practice set
Machine learning has a phenomenal range of applications, including in health and diagnostics. This tutorial will explain the complete pipeline from loading data to predicting results, and it will explain how to build an X-ray image classification model from scratch to predict whether an X-ray scan shows presence of pneumonia. This is especially useful during these current times as COVID-19 is known to cause pneumonia.  This tutorial will explain how to utilize TPUs efficiently, load in image data, build and train a convolution neural network, finetune and regularize the model, and predict results. Data augmentation is not included in the model because X-ray scans are only taken in a specific orientation, and variations such as flips and rotations will not exist in real X-ray images.
